# Wirecard ECR SDK

Electronic Cash Register (ECR) Integration is to allow front-line users such as cashiers to input/trigger supported transactions at single point, and at the same time, relevant information needs to be passed to a Payment Device which sends the information securely to a payment host for authentication and approval. As such, there is a need for an interface to send data between ECR and Payment Device.

#Installation
Download the ecr.framework and drop into your XCode project

Alternatively use Carthage to manage the dependency
